          Thank you for completing our Individual Stress Test.
           You are in the high stress category. This may be due to a stressful event, a change in your life or lack of support in your life.What are the three most important things that we need to do to stay alive? Breathe, drink water and eat food. when we are stressed it has an impact on our breathing so having a simple exercise to hand to use in these situations is very useful.Make the most of your mornings – Weekend mornings are more often than not wasted by our obsession with having a lay in! Which is all well and good, but what if you got up semi early and maximised your time? Use the mornings as ‘me time’ before your weekend chores kick in by spending some time on personal pursuits – maybe read or go for a jog, start your day well!
